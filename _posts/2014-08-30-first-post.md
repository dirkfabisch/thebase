Welcome to my Blog

I know: a blog is totally old school. Why not Facebook, Twitter or something new and more hip.  I think 140 characters are not enough to explain complex thoughts or complicated things. Therefore her it is: "The Base"

Topics I will try to cover:

* My road to CarbBook 2 - the successor of [CarbBook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carbbook/id687057144?mt=8&ign-mpt=u).
* The world of Swift and my attempt to understand the new language
* And my endless journey getting better in photography
